    ``sgr build my.splitfile``

    Executes ``my.splitfile`` and writes its output into a new repository with a random name unless
    the name is specified in the Splitfile.

    ``sgr build my.splitfile -o mynew/repo``

    Executes ``my.splitfile`` and writes its output into ``mynew/repo``.

    ``sgr build my_other.splitfile -o mynew/otherrepo --args PARAM1 VAL1 --args PARAM2 VAL2``

    """
    Reconstruct the provenance of an image.

    This crawls the history of a Splitgraph image to produce a list of images that were used by the Splitfile
    that created it, or a Splitfile with the same effect.

    ``IMAGE_SPEC`` must be of the form ``[NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY[:HASH_OR_TAG]``.
    If no tag is specified, ``latest`` is used.

    Examples:

    Assume ``my/repo`` is produced by the following Splitfile:

        FROM MOUNT [...] IMPORT external_table
        FROM noaa/climate IMPORT {SELECT * FROM rainfall_data WHERE state = 'AZ'} AS rainfall_data

    ``my/repo`` will have 2 images: one having ``hash_1`` (with the ``external_table`` imported from a mounted database)
    and one having ``hash_2`` (with both ``external_table`` and the ``rainfall_data`` containing the result
    of the query run against the then-latest image in the ``noaa/climate`` repository).

    In this case:

    ``sgr provenance my/repo``

    Returns a list of repositories and images that were imported by the Splitfile that constructed this image::

        my/repo:[hash_2] depends on:
        noaa/climate:[hash_3]

    Where ``hash_3`` is the hash of the latest image in the ``noaa/climate`` repository at the time the original
    Splitfile was run. However:

    ``sgr provenance -f my/repo``

    Will try to reconstruct the Splitfile that can be used to build this image. Since the FROM MOUNT command isn't
    reproducible (requires access to the original external database, which is a moving target), this will fail.

    If ``-e`` is passed, this will base the image on the first image that can't be reproduced:

        sgr provenance -ef my/repo

        # Splitfile commands used to reconstruct my/repo:[hash of the second layer]
        FROM my/repo:[hash_1]
        FROM noaa/climate:[hash_3] IMPORT {SELECT * FROM rainfall_data WHERE state = 'AZ'}

    Rebuild images against different dependencies.

    Examines the provenance of a Splitgraph image created by a Splitfile and reruns it against different images than
    the ones that were imported by the original run.

    Examples:

    ``sgr rebuild my/repo --against noaa/climate:old_data``

    Reconstructs the Splitfile used to create ``my/repo:latest``, replaces all imports from ``noaa/climate`` with
    imports from ``noaa/climate:old_data`` and reruns the Splitfile.

    ``sgr rebuild my/repo:other_tag -u``

    Rebuilds ``my_repo:other_tag`` against the latest versions of all of its dependencies.
