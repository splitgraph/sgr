    Delete schemas, repositories or images.

    If the target of this command is a Postgres schema, this performs DROP SCHEMA CASCADE.

    If the target of this command is a Splitgraph repository, this deletes the repository and all of its history.

    If the target of this command is an image, this deletes the image and all of its children.

    In any case, this command will ask for confirmation of the deletion, unless ``-y`` is passed. If ``-r``
    (``--remote``), is passed, this will perform deletion on a remote Splitgraph engine (registered in the config)
    instead, assuming the user has write access to the remote repository.

    This does not delete any physical objects that the deleted repository/images depend on:
    use ``sgr cleanup`` to do that.

    Examples:

    ``sgr rm temporary_schema``

    Deletes ``temporary_schema`` from the local engine.

    ``sgr rm --remote data.splitgraph.com username/repo``

    Deletes ``username/repo`` from the Splitgraph registry.

    ``sgr rm -y username/repo:old_branch``

    Deletes the image pointed to by ``old_branch`` as well as all of its children (images created by a commit based
    on this image), as well as all of the tags that point to now deleted images, without asking for confirmation.
    Note this will not delete images that import tables from the deleted images via Splitfiles or indeed the
