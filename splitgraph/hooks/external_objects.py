    Framework for allowing to dump objects from the Splitgraph cache to an external location. This allows

    External object handlers must extend this class and be registered in the Splitgraph config.

    For an example of how this can be used, see splitgraph.hooks.s3: it's a handler allowing objects to be
    uploaded to S3/S3-compatible host using the Minio API. It's registered in the config as follows::

        [external_handlers]
        S3=splitgraph.hooks.s3.S3ExternalObjectHandler

    The protocol and the URLs returned by this handler are stored in splitgraph_meta.external_objects
    and used to download the objects back into the Splitgraph cache when they are needed.
