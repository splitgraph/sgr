    Homomorphic hashing similar to LtHash (but limited to being backed by 256-bit hashes). The main property is that

    rows and then do bit-wise addition / subtraction of individual hashes to come up with the full table hash.

    Hence, the content hash of any Splitgraph table fragment is the sum of hashes of its added rows minus the sum
    of hashes of its deleted rows (including the old values of the rows that have been updated). This has a very
    useful implication: the hash of a full Splitgraph table is equal to the sum of hashes of its individual fragments.

        When partitioning data, if the table doesn't have a primary key, we use a "surrogate"
        primary key by concatenating the whole row as a string on the PG side (this is because
        the whole row can sometimes contain NULLs which we can't compare in PG).

        We need to mimic this when calculating if the objects we're about to scan through
        overlap: e.g. using string comparison, "(some_country, 100)" < "(some_country, 20)",
        whereas using typed comparison, (some_country, 100) > (some_country, 20).

        To do this, we use a similar hack from when calculating changeset hashes: to avoid having
        to reproduce how PG's ::text works, we give it back the rows and get it to cast them
        to text for us.
