markers =
    mounting: Requires one of the databases in mounting.yml to be up (testing FDW mounting for Mongo/MySQL/Postgres)
    registry: Tests that use a remote engine and that can be run against the registry instead (run as an unprivileged user and don't require object storage or checkouts to work)
    example: Tests Splitgraph examples in examples/, requires the .core.yml docker-compose test project to be down (as it spins up its own Splitgraph engines).
