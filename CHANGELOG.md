# Changelog

## v0.3.12 (2022-07-28)
  * Bump PostGIS deps in Engine

## v0.3.11 (2022-07-28)

  * Fix bug for Python 3.10 compatibility (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/704)
  * `sgr engine add` password prompt clarification (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/709)

## v0.3.10 (2022-06-08)

  * Fix surrogate PK object ordering edge case, impacting some LQ mounts (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/681).
  * Add new `postgres_fdw` params: `use_remote_estimate` and `fetch_size` (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/678)
  * Add support for writable LQ to Splitfiles (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/668)

## v0.3.9 (2022-04-26)

Add support for writes when using layered querying (`sgr checkout --layered`) (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/662). Note
schema changes when an image is checked out in layered querying mode are currently unsupported.

Also add support for using writeable layered querying when using Splitfiles (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/668).

## v0.3.8 (2022-03-18)

  * Fix slow startup of `sgr` binary on Mac OS / Darwin (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/656)
    * Add new release artifact `sgr-osx-x86_64.tgz` including executable sgr, shared libraries, and resources
    * Change `install.sh` on Darwin to default to the `.tgz` artifact (for previous behavior, set `FORCE_ONEFILE=1`)
    * Extract the archive to `~/.splitgraph/pkg/sgr` and symlink `~/.splitgraph/sgr -> ~/.splitgraph/pkg/sgr/sgr`
  * Add support for incremental loads to FDW plugins (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/647)
    * Add a `cursor_columns` field to the table parameters of FDW data sources
  * Fix bug on Windows where `sgr` failed to locate `.sgconfig` in non-existent `$HOME` directory (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/651) _Thanks @harrybiddle!_
    * Switch to cross-platform path expansion when adding home directory to config search paths

Starting from this version, all future releases will include `sgr-osx-x86_64.tgz`, which we recommend installing on Mac OS. The `install.sh` script will default to it.

Note: if you download an executable directly from this release page, using a web browser, then Mac will quarantine the file and refuse to execute it. Command line HTTP clients like `curl` do not have this limitation, and the recommended installation method is to run the `install.sh` script included as a part of every release. See [the pull request adding `sgr-osx-x86_64.tgz`](https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/656) for more details.

## v0.3.1 (2021-12-20)

Fix `sgr cloud sync` invocation issue (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/589)

## v0.3.0 (2021-12-17)

Fleshing out the `splitgraph.yml` (aka `repositories.yml`) format that defines a Splitgraph Cloud "project" (datasets, their sources and metadata).

Existing users of `repositories.yml` don't need to change anything, though note that `sgr cloud` commands using the YAML format will now default to `splitgraph.yml` unless explicitly set to `repositories.yml`.

### New `sgr cloud` commands

See https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/582 and https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/587

These let users manipulate Splitgraph Cloud and ingestion jobs from the CLI:

  * `sgr cloud status`: view the status of ingestion jobs in the current project
  * `sgr cloud logs`: view job logs
  * `sgr cloud upload`: upload a CSV file to Splitgraph Cloud (without using the engine)
  * `sgr cloud sync`: trigger a one-off load of a dataset
  * `sgr cloud stub`: generate a `splitgraph.yml` file
  * `sgr cloud seed`: generate a Splitgraph Cloud project with a `splitgraph.yml`, GitHub Actions, dbt etc
  * `sgr cloud validate`: merge multiple project files and output the result (like `docker-compose config`)
  * `sgr cloud download`: download a query result from Splitgraph Cloud as a CSV file, bypassing time/query size limits.

### `splitgraph.yml`

Change various commands that use `repositories.yml` to default to `splitgraph.yml` instead. Allow "mixing in" multiple `.yml` files Docker Compose-style, useful for splitting credentials (and not checking them in) and data settings.

Temporary location for the new full documentation on `splitgraph.yml`: https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr.com/blob/f7ac524cb5023091832e8bf51b277991c435f241/content/docs/0900_splitgraph-cloud/0500_splitgraph-yml.mdx

### Miscellaneous

  * Initial backend support for "transforming" Splitgraph plugins, including dbt (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/574)
  * Dump scheduled ingestion/transformation jobs with `sgr cloud dump` (https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/577)

    and support sources beyond FDWs. See https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/pull/324 for more documentation and necessary steps to migrate.
  * Added `sgr singer target`, a Singer-compatible target that can read [Singer tap](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md#singer-specification) output from stdin and build Splitgraph images. It's based on a fork of https://github.com/transferwise/pipelinewise-singer-python with additions that let us produce deltas and ingest them directly as Splitgraph objects.

  * Output more query information in `EXPLAIN` for Socrata/LQ.

Full set of changes: [`v0.2.2...v0.2.3`](https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)

## v0.2.2 (2020-09-16)

* Add ability to pass extra server args to postgres_fdw (`extra_server_args`)
* Add ability to rename object files in-engine (utility function for some ingestion).
* Allow disabling `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` and passing a table schema in Postgres/MySQL FDWs.
* Add a fork (https://github.com/splitgraph/postgres-elasticsearch-fdw) of https://github.com/matthewfranglen/postgres-elasticsearch-fdw to `sgr mount`, letting others mount ES indexes. Fork changes:
  * Pass qualifiers as ElasticSearch queries using the query DSL (was using the `query=...` qual as a Lucene query string, which is useless in JOINs. Now we combine both the query implied from the quals and the Lucene query string, if passed)
  * Close the search context on `end_scan` (otherwise many ES queries to the FDW in a 10 minute span would cause it to error with a "too many scroll contexts" exception)
  * Add EXPLAIN support (outputs the used ES query)

Full set of changes: [`v0.2.1...v0.2.2`](https://github.com/splitgraph/sgr/compare/v0.2.1...v0.2.2)
