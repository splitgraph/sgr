## v0.2.13 (2021-04-14)

  * Various fixes to CSV inference and querying (https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/433)
  * Add customizable fetch size to the Snowflake data source (https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/434)
  * Fix issue with changing the engine password (https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/437)
  * Data source refactor (https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/438):
    * MySQL: parameter `remote_schema` has been renamed to `dbname`
    * Mongo: parameter `coll` has been renamed to `collection`; `db` to `database`
    * Table options are now a separate parameter that is passed to the 
    * Introspection now returns a dictionary of tables and proposed table options OR error classes for tables that we weren't able to introspect (allowing for partial failures)
    * Mounting can now return a list of mount errors (caller can choose to ignore).
    * CSV data source: allow passing a partially initialized list of table options without a schema, making it introspect just those S3 keys and fill out the missing table options.
  * Postgres-level notices are now available in the `PsycopgEngine.notices` list after a `run_sql` invocation.
  * Multicorn: fix bug where server-level FDW options would override table-level FDW options.

## v0.2.4 (2020-12-08)

  * Mount handlers are now called "data sources", a generalization that will make them more pluggable
    and support sources beyond FDWs. See https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/324 for more documentation and necessary steps to migrate.
  * Added `sgr singer target`, a Singer-compatible target that can read [Singer tap](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md#singer-specification) output from stdin and build Splitgraph images. It's based on a fork of https://github.com/transferwise/pipelinewise-singer-python with additions that let us produce deltas and ingest them directly as Splitgraph objects.
  * Support for dynamically loading plugins without specifying them in `.sgconfig`, by looking up plugins in a certain directory (see https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/pull/329)

Full set of changes: [`v0.2.3...v0.2.4`](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/compare/v0.2.3...v0.2.4)    

## v0.2.3 (2020-09-16)

  * Socrata FDW now correctly emits `IS NULL / IS NOT NULL`, same with ES (using ES query syntax).
  * Fix array handling (`a IN (1,2,3)` queries get rewritten and pushed down correctly).
  * Output more query information in `EXPLAIN` for Socrata/LQ.

Full set of changes: [`v0.2.2...v0.2.3`](https://github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph/compare/v0.2.2...v0.2.3)

## v0.2.2 (2020-09-16)

* Add ability to pass extra server args to postgres_fdw (`extra_server_args`)
* Add ability to rename object files in-engine (utility function for some ingestion).
* Allow disabling `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` and passing a table schema in Postgres/MySQL FDWs.
* Add a fork (https://github.com/splitgraph/postgres-elasticsearch-fdw) of https://github.com/matthewfranglen/postgres-elasticsearch-fdw to `sgr mount`, letting others mount ES indexes. Fork changes:
  * Pass qualifiers as ElasticSearch queries using the query DSL (was using the `query=...` qual as a Lucene query string, which is useless in JOINs. Now we combine both the query implied from the quals and the Lucene query string, if passed)
  * Close the search context on `end_scan` (otherwise many ES queries to the FDW in a 10 minute span would cause it to error with a "too many scroll contexts" exception)
  * Add EXPLAIN support (outputs the used ES query)

* Extra `sgr cloud` commands:
  * `sgr cloud sql` to query the Splitgraph DDN
  * `sgr cloud search`, a CLI wrapper around https://www.splitgraph.com/search
* Add daily update check to `sgr`.
