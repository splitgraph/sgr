# Splitgraph Driver

A normal Splitgraph installation consists of two components: the Splitgraph
driver and the [Splitgraph client](https://www.github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph),
which talks to the driver. The driver is a docker image which is built from
the Dockerfile in this repository.

The basic idea is to run the driver with specific credentials and db name
(see below) and to make sure the client is configured with those same credentials.

The published docker image can be found on Docker hub at
[splitgraph/driver](https://hub.docker.com/r/splitgraph/driver/)

## What's Inside

Currently, the driver is based on the
[official Docker postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/), and
performs a few additional tasks necessary for running splitgraph and mounting
external databases (only mongo and postgres at the moment):

* Installs foreign data wrapper (FDW) extensions:
    * [EnterpriseDB/mongo_fdw](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/mongo_fdw.git)
       to allow mounting of mongo databases
    * [postgres_fdw](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/postgres-fdw.html)
      to allow mounting of external postgres databases
    * [EnterpriseDB/mysql_fdw](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/mysql_fdw.git)
       to allow mounting of MySQL (version 8) databases

## Running the driver

Simply use `docker run`, or alternatively `docker-compose`.

For example, to run with forwarding from the host
port `5432` to the `splitgraph/driver` image using password `supersecure`,
default user `clientuser`, and database `cachedb` (see "environment variables"):

**Via `docker run`:**

``` bash
docker run -d \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    splitgraph/driver
```

**Via `docker-compose`:**

``` yml
driver:
  image: splitgraph/driver
  ports:
    - 5432:5432
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure
```

And then simply run `docker-compose up -d driver`

**Important**:  Make sure that your
[splitgraph client](https://www.github.com/splitgraph/splitgraph) is configured
to connect to the driver using the credentials and port supplied when running it.

### Environment variables

All of the environment variables documented in the
[official Docker postgres image](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/) apply to
the driver. At the moment, there are no additional environment variables
necessary. Specifically, the necessary environment variables:

- `POSTGRES_USER`: Defaults to `clientuser`
- `POSTGRES_DB`: Defaults to `cachedb`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`: Must be set by you

## Extending the driver

Because `splitgraph/driver` is based on the official docker postgres
image, it behaves in the same way as
[documented on Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres/).
Specifically, the best way to extend it is to add `.sql` and `.sh`
scripts to `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`. These files are executed in executed
in sorted name order as defined by the current locale. If you would like to
run your files _after_ splitgraph init scripts, see the scripts in the
`init_scripts` directory. Splitgraph prefixes scripts with three digit numbers
starting from `000`, `001`, etc., so you should name your files accordingly.

You can either add these scripts at build time (i.e., create a new `Dockerfile`
that builds an image based on `splitgraph/driver`), or at run time by mounting
a volume in  `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/`.

**Important Note:** No matter which method you use (extending the image or
mounting a volume), Postgres will only run these init scripts on the *first run*
of the container, so if you want to add new scripts you will need to `docker rm`
the container to force the initialization to run again.

### Adding additional init scripts at build time by creating a new image

Here is an example `Dockerfile` that extends `splitgraph/driver` and performs
some setup before and after the splitgraph init:

``` Dockerfile
FROM splitgraph/driver

# Use 0000_ to force sorting before splitgraph 000_
COPY setup_before_splitgraph.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/0000_setup_before_splitgraph.sql

# Do not prefix with digits to force sorting after splitgraph xxx_
COPY setup_after_splitgraph.sql /docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup_after_splitgraph.sql
```

Then you can just build it and run it as usual (see "Running the driver"):

```
docker build . -t my-splitgraph-driver
```

### Adding additional init scripts at run time by mounting a volume

Just mount your additional init scripts in `/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/` the
same as you would if you were adding them at build time (same lexiographical
rules apply):

**Via `docker run`:**

``` bash
docker run -d \
    -v "$PWD/setup_before_splitgraph.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/0000_setup_before_splitgraph.sql" \
    -v "$PWD/setup_after_splitgraph.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup_after_splitgraph.sql" \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure \
    -p 5432:5432 \
    splitgraph/driver
```

**Via `docker compose`:**

``` yml
driver:
  image: splitgraph/driver
  ports:
    - 5432:5432
  environment:
    - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=supersecure
  expose:
    - 5432
  volumes:
      - ./setup_before_splitgraph.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/0000_setup_before_splitgraph.sql
      - ./setup_after_splitgraph.sql:/docker-entrypoint-initdb.d/setup_after_splitgraph.sql
```

And then `docker-compose up -d driver`
