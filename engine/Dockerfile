# Multistage Dockerfile to build the Splitgraph engine: because of all the compilation of
# FDWs/libraries needed, we have to download a few hundred MB of dev tooling which we don't
# need at runtime. So, we define a single "toolchain" image, multiple images that build various
# FDWs and other extensions from it and then the final engine image that cherry-picks required
# binaries from the previous build stages: this is done by "make installing" them into a different
# prefix (PGXS's feature) and then copying that over into the filesystem root in the target.
