# Sample dbt project referencing data from all ingested/added Splitgraph datasets.
# This is not ready to run, as you'll need to:
#
#   * Manually define tables in your sources (see models/staging/sources.yml, "tables" sections)
#   * Reference the sources using the source(...) macros (see 
#     models/staging/(source_name)/source_name.sql for an example)
#   * Write the actual models

# Note that the Splitgraph runner overrides this at runtime, so this is only useful
# if you are running a local Splitgraph engine and are developing this dbt model against it.
