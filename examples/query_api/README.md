# Splitgraph query API 

This example will:

* upload the RDU weather dataset from the CSV demo to Splitgraph
* use the autogenerated [Postgrest](https://postgrest.org) endpoint for this dataset
  to query it
* use the Splitgraph query API to run a couple of Splitfile commands joining this dataset with [US domestic flights from 1990 to 2009](https://archive.org/details/icsdata-d35-million-us-domestic-flights-from-1990-to-2009_20100803170854-tsv) to generate a table of average temperature at Raleigh-Durham Airport and the total passenger count in a given month
* pull the created dataset and inspect it.

## Running the example

Copy your .sgconfig file into this directory (it must contain API credentials to access
data.splitgraph.com). If you don't have them yet, take a look at the
[getting started example](../get-started/README.md) or register using `sgr cloud register`.

Change the `splitgraph_demo` username in the example file to yours.

Then, run `../run_example.py example.yaml`.
