# Splitgraph Cloud: publishing data and the Query API 

This example will:

* upload the RDU weather dataset from the CSV demo to Splitgraph, making
  it viewable on [the Splitgraph registry](https://www.splitgraph.com/splitgraph-demo/weather)
* upload its description to the registry
* use the autogenerated [Postgrest](https://postgrest.org) endpoint for this dataset
  to query it
* use the Splitgraph query API to run a couple of Splitfile commands joining this dataset with [US domestic flights from 1990 to 2009](https://www.splitgraph.com/splitgraph/domestic_us_flights) ([source](https://archive.org/details/icsdata-d35-million-us-domestic-flights-from-1990-to-2009_20100803170854-tsv)) to generate a table of average temperature at Raleigh-Durham Airport and the total passenger count in a given month
* pull the created dataset and inspect it.

## Running the example

Copy your .sgconfig file into this directory (it must contain API credentials to access
data.splitgraph.com). If you don't have them yet, take a look at the
[Splitgraph Cloud reference](https://www.splitgraph.com/docs/splitgraph_cloud/introduction) or register using `sgr cloud register`.

Change the `splitgraph-demo` username in the example file to yours.

Then, run `../run_example.py example.yaml` and press ENTER when prompted to go through the steps.
