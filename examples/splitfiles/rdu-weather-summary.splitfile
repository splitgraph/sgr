# First, import the original data table: this doesn't consume extra space (reuses the same
# object that's used by the demo/weather repository.

FROM demo/weather IMPORT rdu AS source_data

# Now summarize the data
SQL CREATE TABLE monthly_summary AS ( \
    SELECT to_char(date, 'YYYYMM') AS month, \
        AVG(precipitation) AS average_precipitation, \
        AVG(snowfall) AS average_snowfall \
    FROM source_data \
    GROUP BY month \
    ORDER BY month ASC)
